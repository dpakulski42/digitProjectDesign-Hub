<!--I'm leaving this as I recoded it in class today. The schema is firing errors 
because. . .the value of the @ref attribute does NOT conform to the xsd:IDREF datatype that I wanted
to show you in class.
To fix them, make the value of @ref conform to the xsd:IDREF.
xsd:IDREF has to be exactly the same as an xsd:ID datatype anywhere else in the document
You can use an xsd:IDREF as many times as you want, and it just has to POINT to an xsd:ID defined somewhere in the document.

    <p type="history"><bg xml:id="shrsbryCake">Shrewsberry/Shrewsbury cakes are a kind of biscuit</bg>. They are less crumbly than a shortbread but have a buttery flavour. Sweet foods like biscuits were popular with the Georgians and were easier to make because of the the increased <bg xml:id="bgSugar">importing of sugar from the sugar plantations in the Caribbean</bg>. They were made to accompany many dishes but were popular with syllabub, which is a <bg xml:id="bgSyllabub">sugared, whipped cream, flavoured with cider or sherry</bg>. Sugar was an <bg xml:id="bgSugarTrade">important trade item and refined (white) sugar was very fashionable</bg>.</p>
    
    <p>This recipe uses <bgRef ref="casSugar">white sugar</bgRef>, which would have been pinched off a sugarloaf and then ground (beaten) until fine enough to use in the recipe.</p>
    
    <p>Traditionally they are baked as thick, large biscuits and were able to be kept for long periods of time.</p>
    
    <p>This recipe comes from 'A Delightful Daily Exercise for Ladies and Gentlewomen' 
    
        <blockQuote>"Take a quart of very fine <oldSp modern="flour">flouwer</oldSp>, eight onces of fine sugar beaten and cersed, twelve ounces sweet butter, nutmeg grated, <oldSp>damaske</oldSp> rosewater- work together with your hands for <oldSp modern="half">halfe</oldSp> an <oldSp modern="hour">houre</oldSp>, then <oldSp modern="roll">roule</oldSp> in little round cakes about the thickness of three shillings, then take a glasse and cut the cakes, then <oldSp modern="strew">strow</oldSp> some <oldSp modern="flour">flower</oldSp> on white papers and bake them in an oven as <oldSp modern="hot">hotte</oldSp> as for manchet. If the oven be not <oldSp modern="hot">hotte</oldSp> <oldSp modern="set">sett</oldSp> your lid <oldSp modern="down">downe</oldSp> ( there is a long explanantion for testing/changing the heat in the  period oven which i have omitted)  until they be baked enough, for they must lokke <oldSp modern="brown">browne</oldSp> not white. you may keep them <oldSp modern="half">halfe</oldSp> a <oldSp modern="year">yeare</oldSp> but new baked are best."</blockQuote></p>
