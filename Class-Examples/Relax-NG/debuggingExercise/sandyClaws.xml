<Verse>Kidnap <Character who="Santa">Mr. Sandy Claws</Character>...</Verse>

<Characters who="lock">[LOCK]</Characters>
<Verse>I wanna do it!</Verse>

<Characters who="barrel">[BARREL]</Characters>
<Verse>Let's draw straws!</Verse>

<Characters who="shock">[SHOCK]</Characters>
    <Verse><Characters who="Jack">[Jack</Characters> said we should work together</Verse>

<Characters wh="barrel">[BARREL]</Characters>
<Verse><Alias who="lock,shock,barrel">Three of a kind</Alias></Verse>

<Characters who="lock">[LOCK]</Characters>
<Verse><Alias who="lock,shock,barrel">Birds of a feather,</Alias></Verse>

<Characters who="lock">LOCK</Characters>
, <Characters who="shock"> SHOCK </Characters>+ <Characters who="barrel">BARREL</Characters>]
<Verse>Now and forever
Wheeee
La, la, la, la, la

Kidnap the <Character who="Santa">Sandy Claws</Character>,lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then
Turn off all the lights</Verse>

<Characters who="shock">[SHOCK]</Characters>
<Verse>First, we're going to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing we will
Snap the trap and close the gate</Verse>

<Characters who="lock">[LOCK]</Characters>
<Verse>Wait! I've got a better plan
    To catch this <Alias who="Santa">big red lobster man</Alias>
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up</Verse>

<Characters who="lock">LOCK</Characters>
, <Characters who="shock"> SHOCK </Characters>+ <Characters who="barrel">BARREL</Characters>]
<Verse>Kidnap the <Character who="Santa">Sandy Claws</Character>
Throw him in a box
Bury him for ninety years
Then see if he talks</Verse>

<Characters who="shock">[SHOCK]</Characters>
<Verse>Then <Characters who="Boogie">Mr. Oogie Boogie man</Characters>
Can take the whole thing over then
He'll be so pleased, I do declare
That he will cook him rare</Verse>

<Characters who="lock">LOCK</Characters>
, <Characters who="shock"> SHOCK </Characters>+ <Characters who="barrel">BARREL</Characters>]
<Verse>Wheeee!</Verse>

<Characters who="Boogie">[OOGIE BOOGIE]</Characters>
<Verse>Oooooohooo! Yum,yum,yum,yum</Verse>

<Characters who="lock">[LOCK]</Characters>
<Verse>I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door and then
Knock three times and when he answers
<Character who="Santa">Sandy Claws</Character> will be no more</Verse>

<Characters who="shock">[SHOCK]</Characters>
<Verse>You're so stupid, think now
If we blow him up into smithereens
We may lose some pieces
And then <Character who="Jack">Jack</Character> will beat us black and green</Verse>

<Characters who="lock">LOCK</Characters>
, <Characters who="shock"> SHOCK </Characters>+ <Characters who="barrel">BARREL</Characters>]
<Verse>Kidnap the <Character who="Santa">Sandy Claws</Character>
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then see if he is sad</Verse>

<Characters who="lock">[LOCK</Characters><Characters who="shock"> SHOCK ]</Characters>
<Verse>Because <Character who="Boogie">Mr. Oogie Boogie</Character> is the meanest guy around
If I were on his <Character who="Santa">Boogie</Character> list, I'd get out of town</Verse>

[<Characters who="barrel">BARREL]</Characters>
<Verse>He'll be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too, I'll bet</Verse>

<Characters who="lock">LOCK</Characters>
, <Characters who="shock"> SHOCK </Characters>+ <Characters who="barrel">BARREL</Characters>]
<Verse>Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew
Mmmmmm!

We're his little henchmen
And we take our job with pride
We do our best to please him
And stay on his good side</Verse>

<Characters who="shock">[SHOCK]</Characters>
ab<Verse>I wish my<Alias who="lock,barrel"> cohorts</Alias> weren't so dumb</Verse>

<Characters who="barrel">[BARREL]</Characters>
<Verse>I'm not the dumb one</Verse>

[<Characters who="lock">LOCK]</Characters>
<Verse>You're no fun</Verse>

<Characters who="shock">[SHOCK]</Characters>
<Verse>Shut up!</Verse>

<Characters who="lock">[LOCK]</Characters>
<Verse>Make me</Verse>

<Characters who="shock">[SHOCK]</Characters>
<Verse>I've got something, listen up
This one is real good, you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now, in the box we'll wait and hide
Until his curiousity...</Verse>

<Characters who="lock">LOCK</Characters>
, <Characters who="shock"> SHOCK </Characters>+ <Characters who="barrel">BARREL</Characters>]
<Verse>Entices him to look inside
And then we'll have him
One, two, three</Verse>

<Characters who="lock">LOCK</Characters>
, <Characters who="shock"> SHOCK </Characters>+ <Characters who="barrel">BARREL</Characters>]
<Verse>Kidnap the <Character who="Santa">Sandy Claws</Character>, beat him with a stick
Lock him up for ninety years, see what makes him tick

Kidnap the <Character who="Santa">Sandy Claws</Character>, chop him into bits
<Character who="Boogie">Mr. Oogie Boogie</Character> is sure to get his kicks
Kidnap the <Character who="Santa">Sandy Claws</Character>, see what we will see
Lock him in a cage and then throw away the key!!!
Ha,ha,ha,ha!</Verse>

<Characters who="Boogie">[OOGIE BOOGIE]</Characters>
<Verse><Character who="Santa">Sandy Claws</Character>, hm... ?</Verse>
