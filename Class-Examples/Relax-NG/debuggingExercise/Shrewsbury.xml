<p type="history">Shrewsberry/Shrewsbury cakes are a kind of biscuit. They are less crumbly than a shortbread but have a buttery flavour. Sweet foods like biscuits were popular with the Georgians and were easier to make because of the the increased importing of sugar from the sugar plantations in the Caribbean.
They were made to accompany many dishes but were popular with syllabub, which is a sugared, whipped cream, flavoured with cider or sherry. Sugar was an important trade item and refined (white) sugar was very fashionable.</p> 

<p>This recipe uses white sugar, which would have been pinched off a sugarloaf and then ground (beaten) until fine enough to use in the recipe.

Traditionally they are baked as thick, large biscuits and were able to be kept for long periods of time. 

This recipe comes from ' A delightful Daily Exercise for Ladies and Gentlewomen' 

<blockQuote>"Take a quart of very fine flouwer, eight onces of fine sugar beaten and cersed, twelve ounces sweet butter, nutmeg grated, damaske rosewater- work together with your hands for halfe an houre, then roule in little round cakes about the thickness of three shillings, then take a glasse and cut the cakes, then strow some flower on white papers and bake them in an oven as hotte as for manchet.
